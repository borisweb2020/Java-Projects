# Java tasks
## The Java Programming Language Review

This repository presents various tasks whose solution is implemented in the Java programming language.

```bash
javac Main.java     # File compilation
java Main      # Run the code
```

### 1_Intro
- `Arithmetic.java` - receives two integers via CLI, checks for the input data for integers and execute arithmetic operations
- `Factorial.java` - calculates the factorial and the number of the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive algorithm and a loop method
- `PrimeDivisor.java` - finds the largest prime divisor of any predetermined integer, by using division and the operation of taking a remainder of the division
- `LinearSearch.java` - searches an index of an element in the array by using the algorithm of linear search

### 2_File_Handling
- `ReadArraysFromFile.java` - reads data from file in the form of integers or strings, stores them in an array, and outputs them to the console in the form of the resulting array
- `SortDataFromFile.java` - reads data from the file by lines and sorts them according to the data type and writes them to the corresponding output file
